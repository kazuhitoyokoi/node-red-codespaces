# Node-RED template for GitHub Codespaces

This repository is the template to create the Node-RED environment on GitHub Codespases.
Using the Codespases, you can temporality use the Node-RED flow editor for four hours.
This template will be useful to try Node-RED for hands-on events or personal use.
The followings are step-by-step procedures about how to use this template.

## 1. Create your GitHub account

If you have no GitHub account, create your GitHub account from the following URL.

https://github.com/signup
   
To register for the account, you need to input your information like your e-mail address, password, and user name.

## 2. Extend the timeout of GitHub Codespaces

As the default, the environment prepared by Codespaces will be terminated in 30 minutes.
Because this period is too short to develop Node-RED flows, extend the timeout from the user's settings URL.

https://github.com/settings/codespaces#default-idle-timeout-header

In the text input area, type the maximum value, 240 minutes.
